Simulation files of video PE-60: Critical-Mode PFC Boost Converter. Small-Signal Modelling

Available at: https://youtu.be/uzLm4Y1JPiE

This video shows how to obtain the small-signal model of the critical-model power-factor-correction boost converter. The control-to-output transfer function is derived.
LTspice simulations are shown to verify the theoretical analysis.
